This is a fork of the [Icecast ices0 utility](http://www.icecast.org/ices.php), modified to fix Unicode-encoded ID3 metadata. You can read the full story in the [associated blog post](http://ericheikes.com/id3-fix-for-icecast-mp3s/).

The new [test-src](test-src/README.md) folder contains the debugger/test program.

Check out the [original documentation](README) for ice0 and [Icecast](http://icecast.org/) for how to build and run the utility.
